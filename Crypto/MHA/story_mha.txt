Our teacher accidentaly E-mailed me the list of our class' final marks this semister.
I, being a good friend, added names of my friends who did not give the exams this time and gave them good marks.
I also found this wierd looking string in the mail: 4f53326a45744749636c6b746f784449636c7447
Our teacher hashed the list and sent the list along with its hash.
I tried all known hashing algorithms but couldn't figure out which algorithm was it.
Then I realised my teacher was working on his own hashing algorithm, he might have used that to hash the list.
I looked up on his github profile and found this omitted code along with a pdf explaining the algorithm of his hashing algorithm.
Help me finish his code and generate the correct hash.

There are the changes made by me(in that order):
